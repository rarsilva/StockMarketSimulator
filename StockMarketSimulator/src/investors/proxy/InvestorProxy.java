    If a company sells 10 shares, the share price should double up.
o If any 10 shares are sold (from any company), and a company hasnâ€™t sold any, the
price must reduce in 2%.
o Investors can do as many transactions as they like, but must buy only one share per
transaction. Investors must try to buy shares in as many companies as possible to
guarantee the safety of their investment.
o The simulator should stop when all shares have been sold, or all investors have spent
all their money.
